### Functionality

- When a user navigates to `http://localhost:3000`, they are presented with a dropdown to select the flight number.
- With the flight number, make a request to the server for the seating availability on that flight.
- When a response with seating is received, display the seating input as well as the form requesting user's information.
- User selects a seat, enters information and clicks 'Confirm'.
- Contact the server with the data, and wait for a success response to redirect to the `/confirmation` page.
